### Step 1: Select First Dataset

***

When joining 2 dataframes, it is common to refer to the dataframe that you are joining to as the **'left-hand-side'** or *LHS* for short. 

As many of the ```dplyr``` join functions have an implied direction (eg ```left_join()``` or ```right_join()```), it is important to realise the order of your dataframe arguments will affect the output of the join function used.
