### Number of rows to display

***
To save space, only a few rows of the data are displayed.

You can interact with this by clicking within the field and typing the number of rows that you would like to display. Alterntively, you can click on the arrows to increase or decrease the number of rows displayed. 

Notice the dimensions of the data, displayed under the table. You cannot increase the number of rows beyond the first number displayed there. That is the total number of rows available within the actual dataframe.
